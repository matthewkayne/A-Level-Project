This program is a home automation program with a variety of functionality. Firstly, it can automatically set timers and schedules to automate pre-set commands to control devices around the house (e.g., turning off all the lights after 11:00). Another feature would-be long-distance control, this would allow you to adjust devices from outside your home (e.g., turn on the washer prior to you getting home). Finally, there will be a facial recognition element that will allow you to walk into the home and be recognised by the program. This recognition will link to your pre-set commands that will run as you enter the house.
